<!--  Browsers -->

<!-- 
Web browsers are software applications used to access and display information on the World Wide Web. They retrieve, present, and traverse information resources on the internet, typically HTML documents, which are styled and interactive thanks to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. Browsers render these resources into human-readable formats.

<!-- What is webpages? -->

<!-- 
A webpage is a single document or page that is accessed through the internet and viewed in a web browser. It is typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and can include text, images, videos, links, and other multimedia elements. When multiple webpages are linked together, they form a website.

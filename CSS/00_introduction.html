    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to add style to a webpage.

        HTML provides structure and adds content to a webpage, while CSS enhances the visual presentation of that
        content through various styles.

    <fieldset>
        <legend style="color: blue;">There Are 3 Types of CSS:(fieldset and legend tag)</legend>
        <ol>
            <li>Inline CSS</li>
            <li>Internal CSS</li>
            <li>External CSS</li>
        </ol>
    </fieldset>

    <pre>
    Syntax:
        selector {
            property1: value;
            property2: value;
        }   
    </pre>
    <ul>
        <caption>The basic syntax of CSS includes 3 main parts:</caption>
        <li><mark>selector</mark> - specifies the HTML element that we want to apply the styles</li>
        <li><mark>property1 / property2</mark>- specifies the attribute of HTML elements that we want to change (color, background,
            and so on)</li>
        <li><mark>value</mark> - specifies the new value you want to assign to the property (color of the text to red, background to
            gray, and so on)</li>
    </ul>

        <dt style="color: red; font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">Inheritance:</dt>
        <dd>
            In CSS, inheritance passes the styles directly from the parent element to its child elements.

            The child elements normally take the same styles that have been assigned to the parent, unless they are provided their own styles.
            
            This mechanism ensures a consistent design across a webpage.
        </dd>
        <dt style="color: red; font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">Rule Order</dt>
        <dd>
            Rule order refers to the sequence in which CSS rules are applied to the HTML elements.

            The order of CSS rules determine the priority for the styles. The later rules overrides the earlier ones and ensures that the most recent styles are applied.
            <pre>
                p {
                    color: red;
                }
                
                /* overrides color previous color value */
                p {
                    color: blue;
                }
            </pre>
        </dd>
        <dt style="color: red; font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">Style Rule Hierarchy</dt>
        <dd>
            The style rule hierarchy determines the priority of CSS rules when multiple rules target the same element.

            In CSS, the following hierarchy of style priorities applies:

            Inline styling: Styles applied directly within HTML element.
            ID selectors: Styles elements with specific ID.
            Class and attribute selectors: Styles elements with certain class or attribute.
            Element selectors: Styles elements with specific tag name.
            <pre>
                /* id selector */
                #unique {
                    color: red;
                }

                /* class selector */
                .paragraph {
                    color: green;
                }

                /* element selector */
                p {
                    color: blue;
                
                output:
                    red
            </pre>
        </dd>
        <dt style="color: red; font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">Specificity</dt>
        <dd>
            Specificity in CSS determines which style rules take precedence when multiple rules target the same element.

            This helps the browser prioritize and apply the most relevant styles.
            <pre>
                div p {
                    color: blue;
                }
                
                p {
                    color: orange;
                }
                output:
                    blue
            </pre>
        </dd>
        <dt style="color: red; font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">Box Model</dt>
        <dd>
            The box model specifies that every element in HTML is represented as a rectangular box. It helps to understand how elements are structured and interact with each other on a webpage.
        </dd>

-> JavaScript is the most popular scripting language for the Web.
-> It is easy to learn, lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled language. 
-> It is widely used for web development, both on the client side and server side. 
-> As a scripting language, it plays an important role in web browsers, allowing real-time 
   modification of web page content and enhancing user experience.

Client-side: 
-> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
   Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and 
   respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. 
   Useful libraries for the client side are:  AngularJS / ReactJS / VueJS, and so many others.

Server-side: 
-> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
   For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, 
   and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, 
   or perform file manipulations on a server. 
   The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.

JS v/s NodeJS
JS(javascript)
--> javascript is a Dynamically type scripting language for web.
--> it is single threade programming language.
--> Asynchronous 

what is Node.Js ?
--> it is runtime for javascript
--> javascript ne execute karva mate ek environment joye (same as any other language)
--> as a human we need a perfect environment to live(H20 , good air , proper temprature , water , food ...)
--> which allows javascript to run on computer(je javascript ne samaje) thats why we need nodejs.

application of javascript:
--> Front-end 
--> Back-end
--> game development
--> machine learnnig
--> IOT(machine to machine comunication)
--> mobile app development

Life cycle : child             --> we do same to learn computer language(javascript / java / python ...)

1. born                        --> install 
2. name                        --> veriables       
3. aware about family type     --> data types
4. comparision                 --> operaters (arithmatic / ternary / ....)
5. conditionals                --> coditional (if / else)
6. repitative things           --> loops (for / while / do-while)            
7. reuse things                --> functions
8. interaction with real world --> OOPs
9. mistake                     --> exception handling

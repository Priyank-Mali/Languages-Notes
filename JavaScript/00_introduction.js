-> JavaScript is the most popular scripting language for the Web.
-> invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser
-> It is easy to learn, lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled language. 
-> It is widely used for web development, both on the client side and server side. 
-> As a scripting language, it plays an important role in web browsers, allowing real-time 
   modification of web page content and enhancing user experience.

Client-side: 
-> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
   Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and 
   respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. 
   Useful libraries for the client side are:  AngularJS / ReactJS / VueJS, and so many others.

Server-side: 
-> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
   For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, 
   and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, 
   or perform file manipulations on a server. 
   The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.

JS v/s NodeJS
JS(javascript)
--> javascript is a Dynamically type scripting language for web.
--> it is single threade programming language.
--> Asynchronous 

what is Node.Js ?
--> it is runtime for javascript
--> javascript ne execute karva mate ek environment joye (same as any other language)
--> as a human we need a perfect environment to live(H20 , good air , proper temprature , water , food ...)
--> which allows javascript to run on computer(je javascript ne samaje) thats why we need nodejs.

application of javascript:
--> Front-end 
--> Back-end
--> game development
--> machine learnnig
--> IOT(machine to machine comunication)
--> mobile app development

--> Web Devlopment : 
      jQuery
      Angular js
      React js
      VueJs
      NodeJs

--> Desktop App
      Electron js 

--> Examples:
   Dropdown Menu
   Animated Sliders
   Maps
   Chart-graphs
   pop-up window
   audio players
   video player
   zoom effects
   animated gallery
   form validations
   accordions
   calendar

Life cycle : child             --> we do same to learn computer language(javascript / java / python ...)

1. born                        --> install 
2. name                        --> veriables       
3. aware about family type     --> data types
4. comparision                 --> operaters (arithmatic / ternary / ....)
5. conditionals                --> coditional (if / else)
6. repitative things           --> loops (for / while / do-while)            
7. reuse things                --> functions
8. interaction with real world --> OOPs
9. mistake                     --> exception handling

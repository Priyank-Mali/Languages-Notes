        /*
            1. In asynchronous code execution, statements can be executed in a non-blocking manner.
            This means that statements can be initiated and allowed to run in the background while other code continues to execute.
   
            2. Asynchronous operations do not block the execution thread, allowing other tasks to be performed concurrently.
        
            3. Asynchronous operations typically involve  :
            callbacks, 
            promises, or 
            async/await syntax 
            
            to handle the result of the operation once it completes.

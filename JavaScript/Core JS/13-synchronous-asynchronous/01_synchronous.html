            (this is blocking processing)

            1. In synchronous code execution, statements are executed sequentially, one after the other, in the order they appear in the code.

            2. Each statement must wait for the previous one to finish before it can execute.
            
            3. Synchronous code blocks the execution thread until it completes, meaning that other tasks cannot be performed until the current task finishes.

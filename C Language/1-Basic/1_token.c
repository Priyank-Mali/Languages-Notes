-> What are tokens in computer programming?

Tokens are the smallest individual units of a program, 
representing language elements or symbols such as 
identifiers, keywords, constants, operators, special characters, and strings.

-> How do tokens contribute to programming?

Tokens serve as the building blocks used to construct the syntax and structure of a program, 
enabling the compiler or interpreter to understand and process the code accurately.

Examples of tokens include variable names (identifiers), 
keywords like "if" and "while," 
numerical constants such as 3.14, 
arithmetic operators like + and -, 
punctuation symbols such as parentheses (), and 
string literals like "Hello, World!".

// What is C?
// C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
// It is a very popular language, despite being old. The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science.
// C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
// that has been widely used for over 50 years.
// C is very powerful it has been used to develop operating systems, databases, applications, etc.


// Why Learn C?
// It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
// If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
// C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
// C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies

# include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Hello, World!!\n");
    printf("I am learning C language.\t");
    printf("d\\myfolder\\myfile\n");
    printf("C is \"very fast\"");
    return 0;
}

/*
Line 1: #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, such as printf() (used in line 18). Header files add functionality to C programs.

Line 2: A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.

Line 3: Another thing that always appear in a C program is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

Line 4: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen.
What is \n exactly?
The newline character (\n) is called an "escape sequence", and it forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen. This results in a new line.
\t	Creates a horizontal tab	
\\	Inserts a backslash character (\)	
\"	Inserts a double quote character	

Line 5: return 0 ends the main() function.

// Statements
// A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

// In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

// The following statement "instructs" the compiler to print the text "Hello World" to the screen:

Git and GitHub

    Git is a version control system that helps you manage and keep track of changes to your code or any other files.
    Imagine you are working on a project, and yo want to save different versions of your work so you can go back and see what changes you've made or revert to an earlier version if something goes wrong.
    Git allows you to do this by creating snapshots of your project at various points in time.

    Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub
    related that happens locally on your computer

GitHub:
    Github is a platform where you can store your Git repositories(files) online.
    It's like a social network for code where you can share your projects, collaborate with others, and keep a backup of your work.
    Github also provides tools for managing your projects, tracking issues, and reviewing code with teammates.

/**
 * In the early days of computer programming, programmers had to write individual instructions in the Assembly language one by one.

Later on programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were created. The problem with these languages was that they were targeted at a certain group of people â€“ FORTRAN for engineers and scientists and COBOL for business people.

Then during the 60s a new language called Simula surfaced and introduced the concept of a class, which sort of let anyone make software for their special fields.

After that, during the 80s, Bjarne Stroustrup came up with the idea of combining the general abstraction of Simula with the low level functionalities of C, which at the time was the best language for the job.

Thus, "C with Classes" was born which later became known as the C++ programming language.

The C++ programming language is a statically typed, compiled, multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language notorious for it's steep learning curve. It has wide spread use in video game, desktop software, and embedded system development.

/**
 * What is C++ ?
 * 
 C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

/**
 * Why Use C++
 * 
C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ is fun and easy to learn!

As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

/**
 * Difference between C and C++
C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.

The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.
